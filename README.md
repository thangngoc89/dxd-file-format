# DXD Files Data

DXD is a 3D file format created by Dentsply Sirona CEREC SW. It's used in dentistry for CAD design of tooth preparation. 

Since CEREC SW doesn't provide a direct way to output the color meshes into a common format, this repository is created to provide information for anyone who is interested in reverse-engineering this format.
